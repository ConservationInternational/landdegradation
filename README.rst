landdegradation
===============

``landdegradation`` is a python package to facilitate analyzing remotely-sensed
datasets in support of monitoring land degradation. This project contains 
common code used by the scripts in the `ldmp-earthengine-scripts 
<https://github.com/ConservationInternational/ldmp-earthengine-scripts>`_ 
repository.

This package was produced as an output of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF)-funded project “Enabling the use of global data sources to assess and
monitor land degradation at multiple scales”. The project aims to provide
guidance on robust methods and a toolbox for assessing, monitoring status, and
estimating trends in land degradation using remote sensing technology. For
additional information on the project see http://vitalsigns.org/gef-ldmp.

The Land Degradation Monitoring Project is a collaboration of Conservation
International, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and
Lund University.
